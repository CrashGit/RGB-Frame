# RGB-Frame
Requires AutoHotkey v2


Has been expanded into a gui with more effects here: https://github.com/CrashGit/rgb-master


Creates an RGB frame/border around the monitor with the 'breathing' animation usually seen in RGB software. 

There's only a few variables at the top that you may or may not want to change depending on your preferences.

Works standalone or as an #Include file
